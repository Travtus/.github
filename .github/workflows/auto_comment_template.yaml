            ****************************Main Reviewer:**************************** name

            - [ ] 1. This is a minor change so the checks below do not apply and have not been investigated.

            **************************************************Security (OWASP top ~10)**************************************************

            - [ ] 2. Does not violate OWASP top-10 security concerns or other security concerns - https://owasp.org/Top10
            
            **Code**

            - [ ] 3.1 Packages, classes, and methods have a single domain of responsibility.
            - [ ] 3.2 Packages, classes, and methods are grouped into cohesive and consistent domain model.
            - [ ] 3.3 The code is canonical and the minimum required to achieve the goal.
            - [ ] 3.4 Modules, libraries, and APIs are easy to use, robust (foolproof and not errorprone), and tested.
            - [ ] 3.5 Logic and naming has clear narrative that communicates the accurate intent and responsibility of each module (e.g. method, class, etc.).
            - [ ] 3.6 The code is algorithmically efficient and scalable for the whole application.
            - [ ] 3.7 The new changes have automated tests to cover the business requirements (caveat: we must let this requirement slide for any repos that are difficult to test, or any repos where the tests are being refactored).
            - [ ] 3.8 There is schema-based validation of all incoming/outgoing requests and events.

            **************************Observability**************************

            - [ ] 4.1 All logs containing PII are either set to the *****debug***** level or anonymised
            - [ ] 4.2 Auditable events (for security), such as logins and failures, are logged
            - [ ] 4.3 Error and warning logs will not be vague
            - [ ] 4.4 If a new service: the deployment to Prod will include appropriate alerts (requires confirmation with PR submitter). An alert is appropriate iff it triggers on an error or messages in a DLQ, and it is the service’s responsibility to decide whether an error is critical (i.e., not the callee’s). Examples:
              - Service A calls service B to retrieve a lease. If service B fails there should be no alert because it is service A’s responsibility to decide whether this is a critical failure.
              - Service B receives an async event to insert a lease. It is service B’s responsibility to raise an alert because no other service will be aware of the failure.

            **Architecture**

            - [ ] 5. If a change in overall design, then the architecture has undergone a design review.

            ****************************Technical Debt****************************

            - [ ] 6.1 There are no outstanding technical debt issues that these changes should address
            - [ ] 6.2 Each mitigating technical debt for not meeting some of these requirements has a repository ticket and an associated Kanban ticket for prioritisation.
